# Pick-A-Number
I was in math class then the teacher got bored. So he made us played a game, where we pick a distinct series of numbers. If a number is on the array and at the right order will print '#', if the number is on the array but the number isn't at the right order it will print '*', and if the number isn't on the array at all it will print '@'. The catch is, the way those symbols print wont be in order of the number that is chosen by the player. So I used descending sort by its ASCII Values for each symbols. You can change the answer of the game by changing the array size (sz_ar) and the array (s[sz_ar]) and of course for UI reasons you also can change the list a number to pick on the monitor by changing the "1-n" std::cout;
